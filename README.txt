Advent of Code 2021

Here is the list of all my solutions to the challenges of the 2021 edition of
the Advent of Code (adventofcode.com/2021).

This is the first time I tried it and I decided to try solving all the questi-
ons using pure C (I know, bad choice to achieve high positions on the leader-
boards, but is very challenging and has taught me a LOT!).

Expect a lot of messy code, (but I promise I tried to free all allocated memory
correctly =]) as this is probably my first attempt of using C to write something
not so small.
